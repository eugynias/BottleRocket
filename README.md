## 1. Background

Develop a web application using React to consume a JSON from a URL that lists restaurants; reference screens are included in the Blueprints folder; the idea is to develop a tool 100% attached to the reference design provided that initially displays the list of restaurants based on the consumption of the URL indicated in the instructions PDF, and when clicking on any item in the list, navigate to the detail screen, where you can view the location on an embedded map and additional restaurant information.

## 2. Contraints

- Mobile
- This app has to run on windows ,Linux anda IOS
- The UI has to reflect the requested sketches

- A React system with an HTML input that we can read and send as a request, this result can be interpreted by out logic and display the results in a web document, the user will get its result list (restaurants).
- A React system with an HTML we can view and send a response where by clicking on the image of each restaurant the address is obtained.
- A React system with an HTML input that we can read and send as a request to the Google Maps API to display the information and location of each element.

## 5. Solution Proposal

A react app that can consume the  2 IMDB database .

## 6. Overview

We will create a new react app for consume a JSON from a URL that lists restaurants, and by clicking on any item on the list, navigate to the detail screen, where you can view the location on an embedded map and additional restaurant information.
